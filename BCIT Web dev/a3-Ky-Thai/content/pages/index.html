        <p>The Ha Giang Loop is a scenic driving route that snakes its way through the northernmost province of Vietnam.  It is famous for dramatic landscapes, rice terraces built on impossibly steep slopes and ancient villages with a rich ethnic heritage.  It is no surprise that this been called the most beautiful region in Asia. Until the mid-1900s Ha Giang was isolated from the world due to its rugged terrain but in 1959 work began on the Happiness Road; a 185-kilometre-long road which opened the region up to the rest of Vietnam.   In 2010 the Dong Van Plateau was listed as a UNESCO Global Geopark for its unique karst formations, which further added to the appeal of the region.

Adventurous travellers began exploring and as word spread, local infrastructure improved, and the 350-kilometre loop was born.</p>

        <p>Cau Dat Tea Hill, or Cau Dat Farm Dalat, is known as one of the ideal spots for young people nowadays. Because of its dreamy scenery and endless green tea fields, it is listed in the top 20 tourist attractions in Dalat city. Associated with the streamflow of history, in 1915, Alexandre Yersin figured out Mount Hon Ba. He decided to set up an experimental station and planted cinchona (treating malaria) and tea on the top of the mountain.

In 1927, Cau Duc Farm was founded with over 600 hectares. Plus, there were three hectares of 100-year-old ancient wild tea trees. At this time, the tea factory concentrated on producing black tea to export to France and other countries in Europe.</p>
